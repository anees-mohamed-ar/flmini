**Project Title: Federated Learning with CKKS Encryption**


**Description**

This project aims to enhance privacy in a federated learning system using the CKKS encryption scheme. The system allows users to input data, which is then encrypted and processed. Admins can view both the original and operated encrypted data.

**Requirements**
Python 3.8 or higher

**Install necessary packages:**

pip install -r requirements.txt


**Files :**

**main.py:** Manages the overall flow, allowing users to switch between User and Admin sections.

**encrypt.py:** Handles encryption and decryption using the TenSEAL library.

**database.py:** Manages database operations, including creating the database, inserting data, and fetching data.

**utils.py:** Provides utility functions for client operations and exception handling.

**user_section.py:** Manages the User section, including data input, client operations, and storing data.

**admin_section.py:** Manages the Admin section, including authentication, viewing data, and decrypting data.

**rich_print.py:** Enhances terminal output using the rich library.
